- Modify error handling (we are interested only in the first error printed, since errors my be printed when trying to match grammar rules e.g. see parse_select method)
    - add context error (e.g., see  "Expected `Identifier` `STRUCT`, found `QuotedIdentifier` `STRUCT`." error)
- We are currently considering comparison operators as left associative but they are not. In bigquery this is a valid expression only if you add parentheses (x < y) is False (maybe fix after implementing pratt parsing in expressions)
- Implement Pratt Parsing for operators
- Extract lineage from arrays, unnest (implicit vs explicit), and structs
- Extract lineage from generic function exprs
- Add "filter" lineage
