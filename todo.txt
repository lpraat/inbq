- Modify error handling (right now we are interested only in the first error printed, since errors my be printed when trying to match grammar rules e.g. see parse_select method)
- We are currently considering comparison operators as left associative but they are not. In bigquery this is a valid expression only if you add parentheses (x < y) is False (maybe fix after implementing pratt parsing in expressions)
- Implement Pratt Parsing for operators
- We have a vec in from exprs (we dont need it)
- Adjust parsing for table names without quoted identifiers (e.g., project-id.dataset-id.table-id)
- Add window functions
- Deterministic/better join table association
- Finalize lineage module
- Extract lineage from generic function exprs
- Setup logging
